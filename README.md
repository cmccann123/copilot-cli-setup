# copilot-cli-setup

> Best-in-class GitHub Copilot CLI configuration — custom agents, MCP servers, coding instructions, and bootstrap scripts.

Clone this repo and run one script to have a fully configured Copilot CLI session with custom agents, connected MCP tools, and language-specific coding standards.

```

Then verify everything is working:
```powershell
.\scripts\verify-setup.ps1
```

## 📦 What's Included

### Custom Agents (`/.github/agents/`)
Specialist agents you can invoke with `/agent` inside any Copilot session. All agents are installed globally to `~/.copilot/agents/` by the setup script — available in every directory.

| Agent | Purpose | Model | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| `coordinator` | Orchestrates the full team — decomposes multi-domain tasks and fans out to specialists via `/fleet` | `claude-sonnet-4.6` | Complex multi-domain reasoning and task decomposition requires the strongest general-purpose reasoning model |
| `azure-architect` | Designs and implements Azure infrastructure with Bicep, azd, Managed Identity, and RBAC | `claude-sonnet-4.6` | Deep reasoning for infrastructure trade-offs, security design, and Bicep best practices |
| `terraform-engineer` | Writes Terraform HCL modules, manages remote state, builds Terraform CI/CD pipelines | `gpt-5.2-codex` | Code-generation-heavy workload — Codex excels at HCL authoring and module structure |
| `demo-builder` | Builds fast, client-ready Azure demos runnable in under 10 minutes | `gpt-5.2-codex` | Fast, high-quality code generation is the priority for rapid demo scaffolding |
| `presales` | Builds POCs optimised for live client presentations — visual impact and storytelling | `claude-opus-4.6` | Most nuanced and creative model — best suited for persuasive, client-facing narrative |
| `code-reviewer` | Reviews code for security issues, Azure anti-patterns, and correctness bugs only | `gpt-5.3-codex` | Sharpest code comprehension for precise security and correctness analysis |
| `diagram-architect` | Creates and updates architecture diagrams using draw.io with official Azure icons | `claude-sonnet-4.6` | Structural and spatial reasoning produces cleaner, better-organised architecture diagrams |
| `solution-designer` | Produces HLD/LLD design documents, ADRs, and technical specs | `claude-sonnet-4.6` | Long-form structured reasoning and technical writing are core Claude strengths |
| `python-engineer` | Python specialist — FastAPI, async, pydantic, Azure SDK, pytest | `gpt-5.3-codex` | Best-in-class code generation and Python-specific pattern recognition |
| `pipeline-engineer` | CI/CD pipelines — GitHub Actions and Azure DevOps for Terraform and Python workloads | `gpt-5.2-codex` | YAML-heavy, pattern-driven work — Codex handles pipeline syntax and structure reliably |
| `security-hardening` | Cloud security assessments — IAM, network exposure, secrets management, Defender, compliance | `claude-sonnet-4.6` | Security analysis requires nuanced reasoning across risk, compliance, and architecture context |

### Coding Instructions (`/.github/instructions/`)
Language-specific rules automatically applied when Copilot works on matching files:
- `python.instructions.md` — async patterns, Azure SDK, FastAPI structure
- `typescript.instructions.md` — strict types, React Query, Tailwind
- `bicep.instructions.md` — naming conventions, Managed Identity, modules

### MCP Servers (`/mcp/`)
Pre-configured Model Context Protocol servers that connect Copilot to external tools and data:

| Server | Type | Purpose | Auth |
|--------|------|---------|------|
| **Playwright** | stdio (npx) | Browser automation — UI testing, scraping | None |
| **Azure MCP** | stdio (npx) | Azure resource management directly from Copilot | Service principal (Key Vault) |
| **Context7** | HTTP (remote) | Real-time library documentation lookup | None |
| **Microsoft Learn** | HTTP (remote) | Official Microsoft/Azure docs — eliminates hallucinations | None |
| **Excalidraw** | stdio (npx) | Clean architecture diagram generation and export | None |
| **Terraform** | stdio (Docker) | HashiCorp official — registry search, provider/module docs, workspace management, plan/apply | `TFE_TOKEN` (HCP Terraform only) |
| **Azure DevOps** | stdio (npx) | Repos, work items, pipelines, boards | `AZURE_DEVOPS_ORG_URL`, `AZURE_DEVOPS_PAT` |
| **Vault** | stdio (Docker) | HashiCorp official — secrets management, KV operations | `VAULT_ADDR`, `VAULT_TOKEN` |

> `context7` and `microsoft-learn` are remote HTTP servers — no local install required.
> `terraform` and `vault` require Docker — no npm install needed.

### Bootstrap Scripts
- `setup.ps1` / `setup.sh` — installs dependencies, copies MCP config, optionally pulls secrets from Azure Key Vault
- `scripts/verify-setup.ps1` — checks everything is correctly configured

---

## 🔌 How MCP Setup Works

Running `setup.ps1` configures MCP in 7 steps:

| Step | What happens |
|------|-------------|
| 1 | Checks prerequisites (PowerShell 6+, Copilot CLI, Azure CLI, Node.js, Docker) |
| 2 | Creates `~/.copilot/` config directory |
| 3 | Copies `mcp/mcp-config.template.json` → `~/.copilot/mcp-config.json` |
| 4 | *(Optional)* Pulls secrets from Azure Key Vault and substitutes `${PLACEHOLDER}` values |
| 5 | Copies agents, skills, and `copilot-instructions.md` to `~/.copilot/` globally |
| 6 | Installs `@playwright/mcp`, `@azure/mcp`, `@scofieldfree/excalidraw-mcp`, and `@tiberriver256/mcp-server-azure-devops` via npm |

The MCP config template is **never overwritten** once copied. Delete `~/.copilot/mcp-config.json` manually to reset.

## 🔑 Secrets & Key Vault

Secrets are never committed to this repo. The MCP config template uses `${PLACEHOLDER}` values.

To automatically fill secrets from Azure Key Vault:
```powershell
.\setup.ps1 -KeyVaultName your-keyvault-name
```

Expected secret names in Key Vault:
| Secret Name | Used For |
|---|---|
| `azure-tenant-id` | Azure MCP server auth |
| `azure-client-id` | Azure MCP server auth |
| `azure-client-secret` | Azure MCP server auth |
| `azure-devops-org-url` | Azure DevOps MCP (e.g. `https://dev.azure.com/your-org`) |
| `azure-devops-pat` | Azure DevOps MCP personal access token |
| `tfe-token` | Terraform MCP — HCP Terraform/Enterprise API token |
| `tfe-address` | Terraform MCP — HCP Terraform/Enterprise URL (optional) |
| `vault-addr` | Vault MCP — Vault server address (e.g. `https://vault.example.com`) |
| `vault-token` | Vault MCP — Vault access token |

You must be authenticated (`az login`) with access to the Key Vault.

## 🚀 Using the Agents

Inside any Copilot CLI session:
```
/agent
```
Select from the list. Or reference directly in your prompt:
```
Use the demo-builder agent to create an Azure OpenAI streaming chat demo
```

## 🔧 Customising for Your Project

Copy the `.github/` folder into any of your project repos to apply these agents and instructions to that project specifically. Customise `copilot-instructions.md` with project-specific context.
